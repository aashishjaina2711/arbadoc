# Arbalet project
## Hackable LED table for geeks and pleasure
Arbalet is an *ARduino-BAsed LED Table*, a plane surface filled with several hundreds of coloured square lights designed for _Education_, _Geeks_, and _Pleasure_. With its limited number of pixels, Arbalet brings our old 80 arcad games back into fashion through a modern, classy, and hackable device.

Arbalet is intended to be easily reproducible, highly customizable, and programmable to create new games, light animations and applications. It's not only a LED table, it's an open development platform. Whether you're looking for a modern, stylish and ready-to-use platform for your home, or a hackable and original platform to teach programming and develop exciting projects, Arbalet is made for you!

## Arbadoc
Arbalet's source code is organized around three repositories: [Arbasdk](https://github.com/arbalet-project/arbasdk) (Python SDK), [Arbapps](https://github.com/arbalet-project/arbapps) (Applications) and Arbadoc.

This repository Arbadoc contains all extra files and pictures related to the documentation. This is probably not very interesting to browse this repository by hand, consult the [Arbalet wiki](https://github.com/arbalet-project/arbadoc/wiki) instead.
