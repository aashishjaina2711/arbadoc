# Arbalet assembly guidelines

You will find here the assembly guidelines of all Arbalet variants. That will grow up as the community develop new derived LED surfaces.

## Arbalet Lack (v1)

This variant is made to reuse and hack a 500x500mm Ikea coffee table "Ikea Lack" with no particular machine except traditional tools (saw, screws).

## Arbalet Lava (v2)
This variant is made to be easily reproducible in fablabs from scratch, i.e. with no initial furniture. It relies on laser cutting machines whose most fablabs are equipped with.
CAD files and 2D patterns are provided for a precise cut are provided. It also comes with a 6-key touch interface.

## Variant merging
A manually cut grid (Lack) might be a bit twisty due to the lack of precision with traditional tools while a laser cut grid ends up in perfect square pixels.

Therefore, in practice you might want to merge both variant to make your own, e.g. you can hack your existing Ikea table and reuse 2D patterns of the grid to make it precise, or also to make it touch-compatible.
