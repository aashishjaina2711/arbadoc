Indeed you can designate a color indifferently by its RGB 3-tuple or by its name. Since we did not intend to name colors like `'intense red, with no green and very few blue, but more blue than the previous color'` we have not named all 16,777,216 possible colors, but extracted a subset of 140 named colors instead, [whose list is available here](http://html-color-names.com/color-chart.php).
