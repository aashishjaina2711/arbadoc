# CAD files for Arbalet Lack

This folder contains CAD files for Arbalet Lack variant. It's a hack of the standard Ikea Lack coffee table.

We are sorry these files require a closed-source proprietary CAD software Solidworks by Dassault Syst√®mes. If you have the competences to port this work on [FreeCAD](http://freecadweb.org/), you are very welcome to join us, fork the repository and open a pull request.

Note that students are given a free copy of Solidworks [upon request](http://www.solidworks.com/sw/education/SDL_form.html).
